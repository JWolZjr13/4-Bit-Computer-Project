# 4-Bit-Computer-Project

Overview

This project involves the step-by-step implementation of a simple 4-bit computer. It includes the design and assembly of various components such as a program counter, timing/clock system, program memory, and a control signal generator. The computer is capable of executing basic instructions like incrementing registers, moving data between registers, and performing no-operation delays. Each experiment builds upon the previous one, culminating in a fully functional 4-bit computer.

Why This Project Was Useful

This project was incredibly useful for deepening my understanding of fundamental computer architecture and digital logic design. By working through each experiment, I gained hands-on experience with:

Digital Circuit Design: Gained practical experience in designing and wiring up digital circuits using logic gates and decoders.
Fetch-Execute cycle: Understood how instructions are fetched, decoded, and executed in a simple computer.
Timing and Control: Learned the importance of clock pulses and control signals in coordinating the operations of a computer.
CAD: Learned and became adept with the computer aided design (CAD) software KICAD in orded to design electrical schematics of the various components in the project.

Main Takeaways

Fundamental Understanding: This project provided a solid foundation in how basic computers operate, including the fetch-decode-execute cycle.
Practical Skills: Enhanced my practical skills in building and debugging digital circuits.
Microcontroller Use: Gained experience in using microcontrollers for specific tasks, such as emulating read-only memory.
Logical Thinking: Improved my ability to think logically and sequentially when designing and debugging circuits.
Appreciation for Complexity: Developed an appreciation for the complexity and precision required in computer engineering, even for simple systems like a 4-bit computer.

For more in depth information on the 4-bit computer, please refer to the document titled "Final Report SOEN228". This document is the main documentation that i've written to keep track of every step of the project, but is meant to be treated as a "how to" manual on how to replicate the project from start to finish.
